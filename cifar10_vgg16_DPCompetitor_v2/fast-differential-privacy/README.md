# Fast Differential Privacy

*Fast Differential Privacy* is a library that allows differentially private optimization of PyTorch models, with a few additional lines of code. It supports all PyTorch optimizers, popular models in [TIMM](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models), [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) (up to supported modules), multiple privacy accountants, and multiple clipping functions. The library has provably little overhead in terms of training time and memory cost, compared with the standard non-private optimization.

## Installation.
To install the library after Git clone, run
```bash
python -m setup develop --user
```

> :warning: **NOTE**: We strongly recommend Python>=3.8 and torch<=1.11 (it is a known issue that torch 1.12 can slow down as much as 3 times).

## Getting started
To train a model with differential privacy, simply create a `PrivacyEngine`, attach it to any optimizer (e.g. SGD, Adam), and continue the standard training pipeline:

```python
from fastDP import PrivacyEngine
optimizer = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.05)
privacy_engine = PrivacyEngine(
    model,
    batch_size=256,
    sample_size=50000,
    epochs=3,
    target_epsilon=2,
    clipping_fn='automatic',
    clipping_mode='MixOpt'
    origin_params=None,
    clipping_style='all-layer',
)
privacy_engine.attach(optimizer)

#----- standard training pipeline
loss = F.cross_entropy(model(batch), labels)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()
```

We provide details about our privacy engine in `fastDP/README.md`, including the supported modules and the arguments. By default, we use the `'MixOpt'` (hybrid book-keeping [4]) clipping mode (which enjoys almost the same time complexity as non-private optimization), and the automatic clipping function [8] (which does not need to tune the clipping threshold `max_grad_norm`). We support RDP and GLW privacy accountant, and additional accountants can be used through the argument `noise_multiplier`, after its calculation from [[Automating differential privacy computation](https://github.com/yuxiangw/autodp)] library.

Specifically, we allow the gradient accumulation to use very large batch size, which is beneficial to DP optimization:
```python
for i, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
    loss = F.cross_entropy(model(batch), labels)
    loss.backward()
    if i % gradient_accumulation_steps == 0:
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

## Highlights
1. This library enables DP training to have almost **the same time and space complexity** as the standard non-private training. This is achieved by three key techniques as described in [4]: mixed ghost norm, book-keeping, and ghost differentiation. In practice, we observe <20% memory overhead and <25% slowdown across different tasks.

2. Specifically, the mixed ghost norm trick [3,8] overcomes the severe memory issues of large model (commonly encountered by Opacus, which computes the per-sample gradients) and high dimensional data (commonly encountered by ghost clipping, e.g. in Private transformers).

3. We support all [`torch.optim`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) (SGD, Adam, AdaGrad,...) and a wide range of models (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT, ViT, BEiT, CrossViT, DEiT, ResNet, VGG, DenseNet,...), including their parameter-efficient variants. For example, one can run DP bias-term fine-tuning (DP-BiTFiT) by simply freezing non-bias terms, as in `examples/image_classification`.

## Examples
The `examples` folder covers tasks on the table-to-text (E2E and DART datasets with GPT2 models), the text classification (SST2/QNLI/QQP/MNLI datasets with BERT/RoBERTa models), and the image classification (CIFAR10/CIFAR100/CelebA datasets with [TIMM](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models)/[torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) models). Detailed `README.md` can be found in each sub-folder. These examples can be used to reproduce the results in [2,3,4,6,8].
